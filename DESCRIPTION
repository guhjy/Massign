Title: Simple Matrix Construction in R
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Erik-Jan van Kesteren
Maintainer: Erik-Jan van Kesteren <secret@secret.nl>
Description: Constructing matrices for quick prototyping can be very annoying in
    R, requiring the user to think about how to fill the matrix with values using 
    the matrix() function. The %<-% operator solves that issue by allowing the user 
    to construct string matrices that look like actual matrices.
